Purpose: krig_grid and krig_spiral apply the krigging interpolation method to a grid and spiral flight pattern, respectively. Functions other than krig_grid and krig_spiral are functions used to apply the krigging.

Input: when ran as is, krig_grid and krig_spiral will create their own random, gaussian-like dataset and apply the krigging interpolation for the each flight pattern, respectively.
