Purpose: krig_grid and krig_spiral apply the krigging interpolation method to a grid and spiral flight pattern, respectively. Functions other than krig_grid and krig_spiral are functions used to apply the krigging.

Input: when ran as is, krig_grid and krig_spiral will create their own random, gaussian-like dataset and apply the krigging interpolation for the each flight pattern, respectively.

Output: krig_grid and krig_spiral will both generate five figures, including 1) a histogram of the randomly generated dataset, 2) the semivariogram for the given dataset, 3) the original data plotted in 3D, 4) the kriging estimate of the original data in 3D, and 5) the kriging error associated with each kriging estimate.
